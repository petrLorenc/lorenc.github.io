title: Natural Language Processing Part 1 
---

My current research is about NLP with Czech text - I would like to use this interesting topic to be my diploma thesis, so I also decided to create this series to make accesible this interesting topic to everyone. In this series of post I would like to show some pitfalls which I have to encounter with. I will try to make as general as possible (it means that I won't be focused on Czech text but on text in general).

Firstly we need to mention what kind of problems are typically solve in NLP. The basic and most general is the machine translation, it is almost the Holy Grail to create Babel fish. But there also other no-less important fields. I would like to mention chat-bots, email clustering, spam detection and many more.

But almost all research in text have something in common - preprocessing and text representation. For preprocessing we usually talks about stop-word removal (words that has no importance - sometimes is hard to define what is important and what is not), stemmatization (remove prefix and suffix) and lemmatization (transfer word to his base form).
