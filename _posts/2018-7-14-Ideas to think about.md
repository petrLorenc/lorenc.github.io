Several thoughts and advices which I have been collecting since my journey to Taipei. There is no right answer, so you can just think about it by yourself and maybe change your behavior (I am also trying to do it as well). My plan is to make more posts like this.

## Personal

 * **FOMO – the fear of missing out** – keeps us stressed, but the truth is, we’ll miss out on things no matter what
   * So, is it necessary to stress yourself about it?
   * You should find what is important for us and try to not miss that - Is going each day to restaurant important for me? Is running every day good for me? ... Very subjective
 * Sometimes we **feel like victims**, but positive change only happens when you take full responsibility for your life.
   * It is waste of time to complain about the others, because there is no way they will change this way
   * You should admit that you don't have full control about your life - it is a relief
 * Ego is the desire to get fame and recognition without doing the good deeds that are required for us to deserve it
   * **Ego also prevents you from learning new things** (because you think that you already know everything)
   * You can prevent your ego to undermined your attitude by reminding yourself that there’s always someone who’s better in something more than you

## Professional

 * Ask yourself, “What do I hope will happen at the end of the meeting?” Use the answer to structure your opening comments
 * Never share workspaces with anyone, not even your partner, because you don’t want to have to spend time setting up your workspace to your liking every time you arrive at it.
   * Also try to have similar condition on your workplace at your job and your home
 * If the **action takes less than two minutes to complete, do it immediately**
   * If not, ask if you are the right person to do that -> No? Delegate
   * If you are right person -> **Plan it** (see trello board)
