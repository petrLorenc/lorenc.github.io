These last few days I was attending <a href="https://www.webexpo.net/prague2018">WebExpo 2018</a> conference. On one side just because of the curiosity to see what is hype right now in Web. On the other side because I like networking and meeting new people. **I was there like a volunteer** - my usual way to get to conferences :D.

I will try to do **more or less subjective highlights** from this conference, which lasts for 2-3 days (if you include workshop, which I was unable to attend) and was held at Lucerna (right in the middle of Prague). I was able to attend almost all interesting presentation on Friday and one on Saturday (because I had to help with organizing the conferences).


# Highlights

## Susan Lindman

  * **Content from the user is much more trustworthy** - let the user create it (reviews, provide space for that, opinions ...)
  * <a href="https://www.dollarshaveclub.com/">Dollar shave club</a>
  * Best time to deal with PR is 3 months before going to the market
    * Also a good time to make a "friendship" with reporters
  * Do NOT focus on revolution or evolution -> **CREATE transformation**

## WHERE HAVE ALL THE STARTUPS GONE?

  * Bad examples
    * <a href="https://www.ouya.tv/">OUYA</a>
    * PEBBLE
    * <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juicero">JUICERO</a> 
  * Good examples of useless one
    * <a href="http://milliondollarhomepage.com/">Million Dollar Homepage</a>
    * <a href="http://www.somethingstore.com/">**Something Store**</a>
      * You will pay 10$ and will get something for that (with similar value)
    * <a href="https://www.diedinhouse.com/">Died in House</a>
      * DiedInHouse.com is the first of its kind, web-based service that helps you find out if anyone has died at any valid US address. 
  * According to Forbes there is almost 90% of startup failing, but according to Kickstarter the number is only 10%
    * It depends on the platform ...

## Pitch to win

  * Mistakes
    * **Talk too much**
    * Talk about yourself

## JUGGLING WITH CATS: LEVEL PM
  
  * by my favourite speaker **Petr Pouchlý** from <a href="http://www.courtofmoravia.com/">Court of Moravia</a>
  * If you need to spend 2 hours in the kitchen speaking with your colleagues, it is ok if you can vindicate it - but you need to realize that you cannot use that time in calculation of your working schedule
  * Make business meeting in a sauna - like in Sweden. It is much harder to lie when you are naked.
  * We are learning in childhood to obey authority (without questioning)
    * **Is it good?**
    * Would be **open feedback culture** better?

## Ideas and thoughts

  * <a href="https://youarenotsosmart.com/2011/03/25/the-sunk-cost-fallacy/">Sunk Cost Fallacy</a>
  * Use Kickstarter more as a marketing tool - not to get money
  * Steve Wozniak: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MowergwQR5Y">**Coffee test for AI**</a>
    * If the AI is good enough that it **can make coffee** in a place where is for the first time **then it is smart enough**

I was at this conference as a volunteer even last year and I can say that this year was a little bit disappointing for me because of less novelty in lectures (maybe it is because I am attending a lot of conferences these days). Anyway, I would like to thank **Sarka Strossova** for organizing this event this year and I hope that next year would be also with her as the main organizer.
