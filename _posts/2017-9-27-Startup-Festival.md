The <a href="http://www.startupfestival.cz/">Startup festival 2017 (Prague)</a> is a small event which is organized by students of University of Economics in Prague. The amount of shown startup wasn't huge, but in this post I will focus on two workshops which were a part of additional program and I found interesting in some way.

### Lean Startup. by Václav Sušeň

Václav Sušeň explained basic concepts of starting business.

His recommendation about books:

- everything from Steve Blank
- Lean Startup
- Value proposition design: How to create products and services customers want 
- Business model generation
- everything from Alexander Osterwalder

If we want to create a startup we should ask the hypothesis, doing an experiments about these hypothesis and then measure that the hypothesis are right/wrong. It is very important to speak with customer - they usually don't know what they want, but they can show you right direction anyway (atleast they can show you the wrong direction). You should not artifically create the problem to have the opportunity, but you should look for problems which are common (say most 3 common problem of your friend) and look for the oppportunity in solving them.

One of the definition of startup say that the startup is a "group of people" which ARE LOOKING for repeatable, profitable and stable entepreneurship intent. If they stop looking for new ideas and just improving one then it is company, not startup. 

Customer pyramid (more higher = less people)
1. have a problem, proactive in looking for solution, have money
2. have a problem, proactive in looking for solution
3. have a problem, looking for a solution
4. have a problem, know that there is a problem, not looking for a solution
5. have a problem, does not know that there is a one

At the beginning focus just on the TOP 2 LEVELS.

### AI workshop

This workshop was just some overview about current progress in the AI field. Because I have a technical backround, it gives me no additional information.
