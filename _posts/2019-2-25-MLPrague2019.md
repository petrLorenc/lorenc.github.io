Last weekend I was lucky to attend Machine Learning Prague 2019 for free thanks to the <a href="http://www.czechai.cz/en">CzechAi</a>. The whole conference takes two days and there was about 45 speaker, but the **main part was meeting old friends and make the new one**. In the end, I was surprised that there were so many great people in one place. I liked this conference mainly because of them.

I will try to summarize my notes from lectures which I found interesting:

  * **Data-driven System health determination in Monitoring Software for Operational Intelligence (by Vitezslav Vlcek from Broadcom)**
    * What is the anomaly? 
      * Rule is also known as the **68–95–99.7 rule** or the “three-sigma rule of thumb”
      * Detection based on <a href="https://github.com/mxgmn/WaveFunctionCollapse">**Wave Function Collapse algorithm**</a> where you are trying to match different patterns on a time series data and look for anomalies - the advantage is the adaptation to new patterns (it is an anomaly at the beginning, but then it is normal)
      * Need far less data than Neural Networks

  * **Parameter Server Suck, All Hail Horovod (by Ruksi Laine from Valohai)**
    * I have seen usage of distributed computing (by the way, also one of the hardest subject from my master study)
    * For Asynchronous SGD
    * **Ring/Butterfly Allreduce**
    * Framework <a href="https://github.com/horovod/horovod">**Horovod**</a> (Open MPI or another MPI implementation)
      * Horovod is a distributed training framework for TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, and MXNet. The goal of Horovod is to make distributed Deep Learning fast and easy to use.

    * Looking forward to videos/material

# Extra notes
  * Using black-box approach is not enough for winning Kaggle and you also need data/business understanding
  * Massive usage of <a href="https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost">XGBoost</a> in <a href="https://www.seznam.cz/">Seznam</a> for correcting typos in query
    * provides a parallel tree boosting (also known as GBDT, GBM) that solve many data science problems in a fast and accurate way
  * Actual "Last letter" (after committing suicide) usually contains **specific vocabulary, longer sentences and neutral sentiment**

I am looking forward to getting through all these new ideas. Unfortunately, the days have **only 24 hours** ...
