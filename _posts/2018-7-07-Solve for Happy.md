Solve for Happy is a startlingly original book about creating and maintaining happiness, written by a top Google executive with an engineer's training and fondness for thoroughly analyzing a problem. You can find it <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Solve-Happy-Engineer-Your-Path/dp/1501157558">here</a>.

I wouuld recommend to read this book for its interesting way, how to look at human's happiness. I wrote the main ideas for me:

 * Happiness is the absence of unhappiness, caused by the misrepresentation and misunderstanding of reality.
 * “Your happiness is equal to or greater than your perception of events minus your expectations of life”
 * It’s important to understand that you **really know nothing, and that time is, in fact, a human invention.**
   * But if time is just a human invention, maybe we’d be better off without it? The thoughts and emotions that cause suffering tend to have an attachment **to the past or the future**, such as grief and shame over the past or anxiety and pessimism for the future, while thoughts in the present tend to be positive, such as amusement or relaxation.
     * Imagine being unhappy because all the potential partners you meet turn out to be unsuited and worrying you might end up alone in life. **The actual worry is based on a fear about the future** rather than anything actually happening right now.
 * You don’t actually have much control over your life, and your fears are often unfounded.
 * Brain as layers
   * **The filters**. There’s so much information to take in from your surroundings that you simply couldn’t cope if you tried to process it all, so a lot of it gets filtered out. 
   * **The assumptions**. If you can’t see the whole picture, your brain fills in the blanks. These could easily be false, however, as they’re simply  there to form a “complete” narrative.
   * **The predictions**. Something that has yet to happen, so why act as if it has?
   * **The memories**. When you remember something, it’s not necessarily the truth but your own personal record of it.
   * **The labels**. To make sense of things, we tend to put them in “boxes” we can easily understand based on preexisting associations. Labels don’t take context into account, often bypassing the truth.
   * **The emotions**. People often act on their emotions first and look for logical reasons to back them up later. 
 * If there’s a definite risk, the brain often exaggerates ("přehánět" in Czech) the probability.
 * Truth/Ways to be happy:
   * Modern life is overly concerned with action and speed, but a calm awareness of the present moment will keep you happy. (Focus on the present moment.)
   * When you have to do something, **make sure you only do one thing at a time** and fix your attention on it so that you do it well
   * Open yourself up to the potential of change
   * **Focus on yourself and what you have, rather than comparing yourself to others**
   * Unconditional love is the most important emotion, as it has no expectations, and therefore no disappointments. (Give love and love will return)
   * Death is a fundamental part of existence. Acceptance rather than fear will allow you to properly embrace life.
