I managed to do all tests and project required in this semester. I had several subjects but most interesting were these two:

	- The introduction into Natural language processing
	- World economy and entrepreneurship

The first one was interesting because I am kind of fan of NLP in general and I am trying to find suitable field of my master thesis in NLP. So, the other course was very interesting because of a way in showing me very interesting relationship between several economic fields. We also explore a world ranking in several fields (for example in which country is easy to start a business).
