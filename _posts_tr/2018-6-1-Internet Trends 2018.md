by Mary Meeker**

I strongly recommend taking a look at the presentation. But for people who are not willing to browse almost 300 pages, I summarized her summary into several points which I found interesting.

 * Strong focus on easy-to-use product
 * AI listen to words almost like human
 * <a href="https://nextdoor.com/">Nextdoor</a>
 * From buying to subscription
 * Alibaba vs Amazon (Alibaba win in China) - similar products
 * From 12% to 15% food spending in 25 years
 * AirBnB is still cheaper than hotel (but not too much - big difference only in Tokio)
 * Big bang of services and mobile apps
 * More data -> More analytics -> Better products -> More customers -> More data... (cycle)
 * China getting leader in big internet companies (2->9) ... USA from 9 to 11 (5 years span)
 * <a href="https://www.kuaishou.com/">Kuaishou</a>
 * China - market for mobile games
 * Digital grocery store
 * 3D foot scan
 * Mobile payment are getting common
 * <a href="https://www.strava.com/">Strava</a>
 * Decline in email usage (with using Slack)
