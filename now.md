I am currently in Taipei, moving back to Prague at the end of this month. I will dedicate 90% of my time to this activities:

* exercising (6x per week or atlest 3x per week when there is no other option) + cooking (in Prague)
* **doing my master thesis (NER)**
* learning about design, front-end and blockchain
* writing this blog about my study at Taiwan
* travelling, hiking, **meeting new people** and going to meetups
* reading books and listening to podcasts
* improving my managing/planning skills and generating ideas for my startup

I will keep this page updated. (Current version is from 10.6.2018)
